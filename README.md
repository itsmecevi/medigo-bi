## Healthcare Business Process

**Note:** All data provided in this file has been randomly created and does not reflect the state of MEDIGO’s performance. It does, however, resemble to part of the MEDIGO data warehouse and is to be understood as a simplification of our business model.


### **Background information:**

MEDIGO is a marketplace where patients looking to undergo a medical procedure can search for high quality clinics, inquire for the price of a procedure and exchange with clinics and hospitals in order to eventually make an informed decision on where to get the treatment they need.

MEDIGO works with clinics from all around the globe and helps patients from many different countries to get in touch with clinics primarily located outside their home country. MEDIGO makes quality healthcare easily accessible.

At the starting point of the medical travel process, potential patients need to send an inquiry to a clinic through the MEDIGO platform. These patient inquiries are received by a facilitator (someone from the clinics' staff) who will then take upon her/himself to provide patients with answers to their questions as well as with a quote and a treatment plan.

MEDIGO considers that an inquiry becomes a booking as soon as the patient and the facilitator have agreed on a date and a price for the treatment – we would then consider this inquiry as scheduled. After the scheduling of a treatment, most patients ask the facilitator for help with booking their flights and accommodation before going for treatment. Unfortunately, some patients sometimes cancel their scheduled treatment due to unforeseen change of plans.

MEDIGO uses various online and offline marketing channels to attract patients to its website. The marketing team based in MEDIGO’s Berlin HQ constantly optimizes its marketing campaigns so as to reduce the cost per inquirer and to improve ROI.

MEDIGO earns money by charging a **30%** commission on all completed treatments. 



### **Task:**

You are a Consulting at itsmecevi.github.io to help MEDIGO to brief a potential investor on the company's performance, revenues and profits. This investor knows very little about MEDIGO and needs to understand the business as much as possible before making his investment decision. You should find all the information needed for this analysis in the Excel file attached.


1-) Please provide insights on MEDIGO's key business and revenue metrics.
Conversion Rate and Cash Flow Generation are examples of important metrics for MEDIGO but there are many others.


Note: You do not need to create a comprehensive presentation to present the industry, the business model or the company itself. Presenting key metrics and analyzing them is what matters here! 


2-) Please also (shortly) list the information missing in the Excel document and you wish you had to your disposal to either go deeper in your analysis or to calculate some metrics.
